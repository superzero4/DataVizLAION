In fact, smoking is linked to about 90% of all lung cancer cases. But smoking isn\u0026rsquo;t the only risk factor. Exposure to radon, exhaust and other gases can contribute to the disease. And if you smoke, the combination of smoking and radon can lead to an exponentially higher risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRadon\u0026rsquo;s Link to Lung Cancer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRadon is a natural, radioactive gas that occurs in the soil.

Ohio is in the top 10 states in the country where there is a fair amount of radon in the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the radon in the soil is dissipated in the environment. But inside, the odorless radon can accumulate and reach dangerous levels. For instance, basements with leaks or openings in the concrete above a radon source can develop high levels of radon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/provider/ronald-j-wainz-md-pulmonary-medicine\"\u003eRonald Wainz, MD,\u003c/a\u003e a pulmonary medicine specialist with ProMedica Physicians, says, \u0026ldquo;Nationwide, about one in 16 homes may have high levels of radon. So it\u0026rsquo;s recommended that households in certain areas be checked for radon exposure.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike other carcinogens, radon can contribute to cancer from exposure over the course of decades. Most people who are exposed to radon will not develop cancer. However, it increases the risk of lung cancer, especially if you smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re moving or doing construction on your home, consider a radon test to evaluate your exposure. If the radon levels are high, you may be able to lower the exposure by sealing leaks or cracks or fixing your home foundation.

It\u0026rsquo;s also a \u0026ldquo;silent\u0026rdquo; cancer with virtually no symptoms in its early stages. By the time symptoms do appear, the lung cancer has often developed into the third or fourth stage, leading to its higher mortality rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the world,\u0026rdquo; says Dr. Wainz. \u0026ldquo;About 130,000 people in the United States die per year from lung cancer. About 80-90% of those cases are smokers.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRadon\u0026rsquo;s contribution to lung cancer is much, much lower. But Dr. Wainz explains that if you\u0026rsquo;re exposed to radon and you\u0026rsquo;re a smoker, your risk is even higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Most people who are heavy smokers do not get lung cancer.

One of the most notorious upcoming feasts is Thanksgiving dinner. After enjoying a plate full of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy, you might start to feel ready for a nap. While you may suspect the turkey is to blame for your post-feast drowsiness, it may not be the only culprit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDispelling the Rumors\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people think that proteins like turkey are the reason for feeling tired after eating a holiday feast. This is because turkey contains tryptophan. Tryptophan is the essential amino acid in turkey and is associated with drowsiness. Tryptophan is used in making hormones including serotonin and melatonin that help the body relax, along with other principal functions. It is also found in other common foods like milk, cheese, beef, chicken, nuts and soybeans. However, one serving of turkey only contains about 205 milligrams of tryptophan, which is not nearly enough for an adult to feel the effects.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Real Culprit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge meals often involve eating excess carbohydrate-rich foods like potatoes, stuffing, rolls and desserts. Additionally, when a special meal is on the menu, many people like to eat less throughout the day before the meal so they can eat more of their special favorites. This can lead to being overly full and can raise blood sugar, even in those without diabetes. For people without diabetes, the body produces insulin and works to remove sugar from the blood. The higher the blood sugar, the more insulin is released, and can sometimes be too effective leading to low blood sugar, or a \u0026ldquo;crash.\u0026rdquo; Even people without diabetes can experience spikes and crashes in blood sugar, and common symptoms include fatigue, confusion and irritability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAvoid the Post-Dinner Nap\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you would like to maintain good energy after dinner, try to be intentional while making your plate. If you are looking to avoid over-eating, use a dessert plate to have smaller portions of the main meal. Fill your plate with lean proteins like turkey, especially white meat without skin. Lean protein helps keep us satisfied and helps stabilize blood sugar, potentially preventing those tiring spikes and crashes. Other protein-rich foods include chicken, cheese, milk, soy and fish.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlan ahead and have some healthy meals or snacks during the day and enjoy dinner in moderation. Eating something light and nutrient-rich during the day can prevent overeating, and helps you focus on your own hunger and fullness levels. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during and after the meal to support digestion.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re still feeling like you might miss out on your favorites but want to avoid overeating, stop eating once you\u0026rsquo;re full \u0026ndash; there will always be leftovers tomorrow. Once finished eating, try taking a walk outside.
